      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a clerkship coordinator at Feinberg School of Medicine.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Madison, WI, but have lived in Chicago for the past four years.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm into board games, I play a few different games where you build and paint all the models yourself.  I'm also very interested in films, and programmed film screenings for a couple years while I was in college. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>If I could do anything I would love to write critically about games or film full time.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Woodridge, IL.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always been interested in learning how to code.  I'd really like to be able to develop my own apps, a lot of the board games I play have really complicated rulesets that an app could help streamline a bit and I'd like to design things like that.  I am also interested in the career opportunities that a background in coding can open.</p>
